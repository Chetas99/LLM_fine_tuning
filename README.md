# 🤖 LLM Fine-Tuning for Response Classification

This repository contains my solution to Kaggle's ["LLM Classification Fine-tuning"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-classification-finetuning) competition, clearly demonstrating the fine-tuning of a RoBERTa transformer model using Hugging Face Transformers and Weights & Biases (wandb).

## 🚩 **Project Overview**

The objective of this Kaggle competition was to classify user-preferred responses between pairs of chatbot-generated outputs. This was achieved through fine-tuning a transformer-based Large Language Model (RoBERTa), showcasing structured experimentation workflows, effective NLP practices, and leveraging GPU acceleration.

## 🛠️ **Technical Approach**

- **Model Choice:**
  - **RoBERTa-base** from Hugging Face Transformers
  - Sequence classification fine-tuning for NLP tasks.

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Concatenated user prompts and chatbot responses.
  - Clearly tokenized using RoBERTa tokenizer (optimized sequence length).

- **Training & Evaluation:**
  - Clearly implemented PyTorch with Hugging Face Trainer API.
  - Logged and visualized training using Weights & Biases.

- **Deployment & Execution:**
  - Executed training initially on Google Colab with GPU.
  - Clearly documented and demonstrated workflow on Kaggle and GitHub.

---

## 📊 **Results and Insights**

- Achieved initial validation accuracy (~37%) on a quick experimental setup.
- Clearly identified potential improvements:
  - More training epochs
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Advanced transformer models (e.g., DeBERTa)
